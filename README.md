The Rules:

Each player starts with 5 cards.

Players will draw cards to determine the winner of each round. 

The player with the higher value card wins the round, unless the cards are 1 and 5. 

Every card beats 1 except 5. 1 only beats 5. 5 beats all except 1.

Whoever wins the round, takes the card the loser played in the round.

The player who robs the other of all of their cards wins.

The same card cannot be played twice in a row.


UI:

When you select a card, from your inventory on the bottom of the screen, it will populate on the left side of the screen. 

When you are ready to submit your card for the round, press the large pink button in the middle.

The winner of the round will be decided by what you played vs the computer player, Player 2.

The previous cards played will show up outside of the cards being selected.
